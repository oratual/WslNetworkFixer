# Verified Solution - Test Results

## Problem
- WSL2 services not accessible from Windows host
- `ERR_NETWORK_ACCESS_DENIED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` errors
- Common with Next.js, Node.js, and other development servers

## Solution Verified
✅ **`networkingMode=mirrored` in `.wslconfig` WORKS**

### Test Environment
- Windows 11 with WSL2 v2.5.7.0
- Ubuntu WSL2 distribution
- Next.js development server
- Tested: June 12, 2025

### Test Results
1. **Initial Error**: `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` on `localhost:3002`
2. **Root Cause**: Server wasn't actually running (process management issue)
3. **After Fix**: Successfully accessed Next.js app from Windows browser
4. **Connection**: `http://localhost:3002` working perfectly

### Key Configuration
```ini
[wsl2]
networkingMode=mirrored
```

### Important Notes
- The server must be actually running (verify with `ps aux | grep node`)
- Use `-H 0.0.0.0` flag for some servers (e.g., `next dev -H 0.0.0.0`)
- If port is busy, server will auto-increment (3000 → 3001 → 3002)
- No firewall rules or port forwarding needed with mirrored mode

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Server not running**: Check process is alive
2. **Wrong port**: Server might use different port if default is busy
3. **Old WSL version**: Update with `wsl --update`

## Conclusion
The `networkingMode=mirrored` solution is confirmed working. This eliminates the need for complex port forwarding scripts or firewall rules.
