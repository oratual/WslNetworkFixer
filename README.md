Fix WSL2 network connectivity issues with Windows host. Solves the common `ERR_NETWORK_ACCESS_DENIED` error when accessing WSL2 services from Windows.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Download the latest release
2. Run `install.bat` as Administrator
3. Restart WSL: `wsl --shutdown`
4. Access your services via `localhost`!

## üîß What it does

This tool configures WSL2 with `networkingMode=mirrored`, which:
- Shares the same IP address between WSL2 and Windows
- Eliminates NAT issues
- Allows `localhost` to work seamlessly
- No more port forwarding needed!

## üìã Requirements

- Windows 10/11 with WSL2
- PowerShell 5.0 or higher
- Administrator privileges (for first-time setup)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Option 1: Automated (Recommended)
```batch
install.bat
```

### Option 2: Manual
Create/edit `%USERPROFILE%\.wslconfig`:
```ini
[wsl2]
networkingMode=mirrored
memory=4GB
processors=2
autoMemoryReclaim=gradual
sparseVhd=true
```

## üìñ Usage

After installation:
1. Restart WSL: `wsl --shutdown`
2. Start your service in WSL (e.g., `npm run dev`)
3. Access from Windows: `http://localhost:3000`

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Still getting ERR_NETWORK_ACCESS_DENIED?
1. Ensure WSL is updated: `wsl --update`
2. Restart Windows completely
3. Check Windows Firewall settings
4. Run `diagnose.bat` for detailed troubleshooting

### Performance Issues?
Adjust memory allocation in `.wslconfig`:
```ini
memory=8GB  # Increase if needed
```
